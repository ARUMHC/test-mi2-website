Our team has experience not only in groundbreaking research, but also in deploying these research into business.

We perform champion-challenger evaluations in which we look for potential to increase the effectiveness of predictive models in your company.

We take care of the whole life cycle of the predictive models, from reproducibility of results to constant monitoring and continuous improvement of the model.

We audit models and analyse the sensitivity and vulnerability of the model to incorrect or unexpected behaviours.

We conduct trainings for data-science teams interested in the latest results in the area of responsible predictive modelling.
