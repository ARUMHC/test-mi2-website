# MI² Data Lab {-}


MI² is a group of mathematicians and computer scientists that love to play with data.

We are spread between [Warsaw University of Technology](https://www.pw.edu.pl/) and [University of Warsaw](http://uw.edu.pl/).

Data Lab is our creative space, place in which we have workshops, seminars and some experiments. Feel free to jump in. Here we are forging new ideas, creating tools, solving problems, doing consulting and sharing our positive attitude.

#### Mission {-}

Machine learning is like atomic energy. **We develop leaders, skills, methods, tools and good practices so that this potential can be deployed responsibly and sustainably**.

#### Vision {-}

MI² is a group of experts supporting global initiatives aimed at responsible and sustainable machine learning. We support the development of future leaders of responsible machine learning through internships, PhDs, postdoctoral fellowships and so on. We seek for research grants and business projects to conduct both scientific and applied research. We develop and maintain software and infrastructure necessary to build responsible and sustainable ML. We develop cooperation with international teams working on similar topics. We support companies to implement best practices related to responsible modelling in their operation. We conduct workshops and training on responsible predictive modelling.
